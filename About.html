					<p style="margin-top: -3.2em;"><b>A Font Foundry by People for People</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indestructible type* is a font foundry like no other. That is because it operates under the open source model.
						The fonts available at indestructible type* are created by anyone and everyone in need of good typography to be shared with the public freely. Every step behind
						the creation process is public. We believe that in making our process open we are supporting the creations of even better, more versatile fonts. All
						of our typography is free to modify, personally or commercially.
				</p>
					<p><b>Always Improving</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The open-source model also means that fonts available at indestructible type* are constantly improving. Notice something
						in need of improvement? Post a report on <a href="https://github.com/indestructible-type/"><u><span>our GitHub page.</span></u></a> Type designers involved with
						indestructible type* can address issues collaboratively and engage in a public dialogue about the best way to improve the fonts available. Are you a type designer looking
						to improve the functionality of fonts available at indestructible type*? Reach out to us at <a href ="mailto:indestructibletype@gmail.com"><u><span>indestructibletype@gmail.com</span></u></a>.
						Think of us as the Wikipedia of font foundries. Everybody is encouraged to help edit and improve everything down to this webpage.

				<h4 class="JonesM">Mission</h4>
					<p style="margin-top: -3.2em;"><b>Make indestructible type</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indestructible type* has a simple mission: to make indestructible type. Typography should work. It should work on print
						media. It should work on digital media. It should read well at large sizes. It should read well at small sizes. It should feel at home anywhere. It should feel at home
						everywhere. indestructible type* hopes to make typefaces that you cannot be fired for using or will look out-dated in five years. Typography should be so versatile, so scalable,
						that it cannot be destroyed.
				</p>
					<p><b>Stay Human</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We live in an age of connectivity. We have technologies like never before. How we live and work as consumers and producers
						should reflect the changes in how we connect. indestructible type* intends to stay approachable and human. We care about your experiences with our typography and want to
						hear from everybody on methods of improvement. No issue is too small or voice too quiet. Don’t hesitate to reach out, either through our <a href ="mailto:indestructibletype@gmail.com"><u><span>email</span></u></a> or via <a href="https://github.com/indestructible-type/"><u><span>GitHub</span></u></a>.
				</p><br>
				<h4 class="JonesM">Questions</h4>
					<p style="margin-top: -3.2em;"><b>What&rsquo;s with all of the asterisks?</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At its conception, indestructible type* recognized the need for a consistent naming system. Naming the fonts after the designers
						that inspired them is an easy way to pay homage to the original designers. It is already the naming convention for fonts such as Bodoni or Baskerville. The problem is then, how
						does one distinguish our fonts from others with the same name? Adding an asterisk to the end is an easy way to remove the possibility of redundancy and easily distinguishes
						indestructible type* from a group of fonts without adding significant length to the name. It also means that our Bodoni is under the B section in an alphabetized list.
				</p>
					<p><b>How does indestructible type* make money?</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indestructible type* is entirely donation dependant. If you have benefited from our typography please consider <a href ="Contribute.html"><u><span>making a donation</span></u></a>.
						Donations are also a great way to fund new ideas you have or features you’d like to see.
				</p>
					<p><b>What does indestructible type* do with all that money?</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Roughly 50% goes to the
						designers here, 50% to other projects such as <a href="https://fontforge.github.io"><u><span>FontForge</span></u></a> that have made this possible.
				</p>
					<p><b>How are the fonts created?</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There have been two methods of font creation. Either a font is conceived and prototyped on paper before being created from scratch
						in FontForge, or as in the case of Bodoni* a font is created by modifying an already existing font with an allowing license.
				</p>
					<p><b>How does the SIL open type licence work?</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All of the fonts available at indestructible type* are licensed under the <a target="_blank" href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL"><u><span>
						SIL open type license</span></u></a> which lays out what you can and cannot do with our fonts. To fully understand the license it is best to read it, however a summarized version
						is as follows. <br>You CAN:
						<ul>
  						<li>Use the fonts for personal and commercial use</li>
  						<li>Share the font files with your friends (or enemies)</li>
  						<li>Modify the font files</li>
						</ul>
						You CANNOT:
						<ul>
  						<li>Sell the fonts as is (that would be mean)</li>
  						<li>Make a different font with exactly the same name (that would be confusing)</li>
						</ul>
				</p>
					<p><b>When I download the zip file it&rsquo;s empty. What do I do?</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That sucks. This has been an issue with computers running Windows 7 and we are in the process of fixing it. In the meantime, there
						is a link to the GitHub page under each download link. If you click on that it should be a &ldquo;Download Zip&rdquo; link. The zip will have the fonts in a folder called &ldquo;Finished&rdquo;.
				</p>
					<p><b>I want the updated version of a font, but my computer says that it&rsquo;s already installed.</b>
						<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You just have to uninstall it and then install it again. If you are using Linux, check under ~/.local/share/fonts directory. If you
						are in Windows, there should be a fonts file under &ldquo;Appearance and Personalization&rdquo; which is in the control panel. If you are using a Mac, you should install Linux.
				</p>
