			<p>
				<b>What&#8217;s with the asterisks?</b><br>
				The fonts here at indestructible type* are, for the most part, inspired by historical type designers. In order to honor them and the work that inspires these contemporary typefaces, indestructible type* fonts are named after the type designer who informs them. This naming convention is common among typefaces like Bodoni and Baskerville, so in order to distinguish indestructible type* fonts from others, the asterisk is added. This has the added benefit of making indestructible type* immediately recognizable in the font selection process.

				<b>Always Improving</b><br>
					There is a growing trend, in the software world, of considering programs living, breathing, and constantly improving. This is reflected in subscription models, where a program is downloaded and as improvements to the program are made, subsequent downloads are made available. This is not as true in the world of typography, where fonts are seen as stagnant, things meant to be downloaded once. At indestructible type* that is not the case. I recognize the constant need for improvement, and so with every purchase of an indestructible type* font, a free subscription to every subsequent improvement is included. As more styles and features are added, you will remain in the loop.
