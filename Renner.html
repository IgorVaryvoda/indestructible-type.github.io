		<h2>about</h2>
		<p><b>A MODERN MASTERPIECE</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Paul Renner designed Futura in 1927 it looked chic and ahead of its time. Futura is dazzling in its simplicity, welcoming in its rationality. It&#8217;s simple and beautiful. Many fonts find the spotlight for a time, but Futura has remained as relevant and innovative as it was when it was created 90 years ago.
		</p><br><br><br>
		<p><b>A TRIBUTE FOR THE DIGITAL ERA</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renner* aims to keep the attitude of Futura rather than the exact design. Futura was designed to be functional in its day, and in that spirit, Renner* aims to be as functional as possible in the digital era. For that reason it deviates from the exact designs of Paul Renner, favoring, for example, a larger x-height or more balanced capital forms. It also includes some features which would have not be possible in the era of Paul Renner.
		</p><br><br><br>
		<h2>features</h2>
		<p><b>NINE WEIGHTS</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renner* doesn't just come with a book and <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold</span> weight. As of Renner* 3.0 there are now a staggering nine weights. This doesn&#8217;t just make it handy in its expressivity, it also allows it to adapt to all manner of context and media.
		</p><br><img src="Renner/weight.svg">
		<br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<p><b>EXTENDED CHARACTER SET</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renner* has hundreds of characters and supports over 50 languages. It also includes fractions and unusual punctuation such as the interrobang.
		</p><br><img src="Renner/char.svg">
		<br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<p><b>ALTERNATE CHARACTER SETS</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you miss the single story lowercase "a" of Futura? No worries! Renner* comes with a stylistic alternative for its "a" giving you the best of both worlds. Renner* also comes with tabuler numbers in addition to the default proportional numbers.
		</p><br><img src="Renner/tabs.svg">
		<br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<p><b>VARIABLE FONT TECHNOLOGY</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest release of Renner* supports OpenType variable font technology! Loading the variable font version of Renner* into a program such as Adobe Photoshop will allow you to precisely control the weight and italic angle of the font, giving you control like never before. Because this is a new technology that takes considerable time and energy to build, the completed variable font version of Renner* is available for a minimum of $10. The static version with 9 weights is still available for free and the <a href="https://github.com/indestructible-type/Renner" class="red">source code for the variable font version</a> is free to download and comes with instructions on building it yourself.
		</p><br><br><br>

		<p><b>ALWAYS IMPROVING</b><br>

If there are ways that you think Renner* can be improved, <a href="https://github.com/indestructible-type/Renner/issues" class="red">reach out</a> and maybe Renner* 3.2 will include that feature or fix.
