		<h2>about</h2>
		<p><b>A MODERN MASTERPIECE</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Paul Renner designed Futura in 1927 it looked chic and ahead of its time. Futura is dazzling in its simplicity, welcoming in its rationality. It&#8217;s simple and beautiful. Many fonts come and go. Many fonts find the spotlight for a time, but Futura has remained as relevant and innovative as it was when it was created 90 years ago.
		</p><br><br><br>
		<p><b>A TRIBUTE FOR THE DIGITAL ERA</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renner* was built from the ground up to work in the digital age. In designing Renner*, nothing about Paul Renner&#8217;s design for Futura was taken for granted. Letters were created to be the best possible iterations of themselves, while extreme precaution was taken to ensure that as a collective family, Renner* functions seamlessly. This has resulted in numerous notable differences between Renner* and Futura. Renner*&#8217;s weighting system is a bit different, to make it more inline with the typefaces of today. Renner* also has more balanced capital forms, for a better flow, especially at text sizes. It does this while retaining the elegance that defines Futura.
		</p><br><br><br>
		<p><b>FREE AS IN FREEDOM</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us looking for a free and legal alternative to Futura, I got you. I&#8217;ve elected to release Renner* under the <a class="red" href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL_web" target="_blank">SIL open font license</a>, meaning it&#8217;s not only free to use for personal uses, it&#8217;s free to use for commercial uses, and even modify and distribute, assuming the license follows it.
		</p><br><br><br>
		<h2>features</h2>
		<p><b>MULTI-WEIGHTED</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renner* doesn't just come with a book and <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold</span> weight. With version 2.2, Renner* now comes with six weights, spanning from <span style="font-family: 'rennerthin';">thin</span> to <span style="font-family: 'rennerblack';">black</span>. This doesn&#8217;t just make it handy in its expressivity, it also allows it to adapt to all manner of context and media.
		</p><br><br><br>
		<p><b>TRUE ITALICS</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renner* has true italics! Each of the letters in Renner* was reconsidered and redesigned for its <i>italic</i> counterpart, something often skipped in sans serif fonts. This means letterforms that worked for the roman version, are sometimes entirely different for the italic. By going this extra mile, italics don&#8217;t just look slanty, they <i>feel italic-y.</i>
		</p><br><br><br>
		<p><b>KERNING</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kerning is really something to boast about. Kerning didn't just stop at the obvious, like <q>AV</q>. Kerning pairs include subtle combos, like <q>rs</q>. What results is kerning that you don't have to think about. Everything just works.
