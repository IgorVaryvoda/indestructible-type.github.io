				<h3 class="Bodoni12M">Reliable Elegance</h3>
				<br><h4 class="Bodoni6M">Some typefaces are fashionable. Bodoni is beautiful.</h4>
					<p style="margin-top: -2em;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Giambattista Bodoni helped to establish and perfect a new class of typeface over his lifetime: the &#8220;Modern Serif.&rdquo; Building on the designs
					of the likes of Baskerville, Bodoni increased the contrast between the thick and thin strokes, which was made possible due to advances in
					printing technology during the late seventeen hundreds. The result is some of the most refined, dignant, elegant, and just plain classy
					letterforms of all time. Although originally designed for books, the modern serifs quickly found their place as display typefaces. This class
					of letterform can be found just about anywhere from the titles of newspapers, to high-fashion hotels, or advertizing a holiday sale.
					Anywhere where timeless beauty is appropriate, Bodoni* will fit the bill.
				</p>
				<h4 class="Bodoni6M">Bodoni* is an expansion of <a href="http://www.impallari.com/"> <u><span>Pablo Impallari</span></u></a> and <a href="http://www.rfuenzalida.com/"> <u><span>Rodrigo Fuenzalida</span></u>&rsquo;s</a> &#8220;Libre Bodoni&rdquo;</b> <br></h4>
					<p style="margin-top: -2em;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bodoni* was not created from scratch. It was created by taking the pre-existing digital typeface: &#8220;Libre Bodoni&rdquo; which
					is available in two wights: Normal and Bold, and expanding the typeface to a whopping four weights: Book, Medium, Bold and Fatface. Bodoni*
					also improves on the original design with pt. size variants.
					<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bodoni* may be more versatile typeface, but it would not exist without the hardworking and generous people behind
					&#8220;Libre Bodoni.&rdquo; &#8220;Libre Bodoni&rdquo; is available for download <a href="https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Bodoni"><u><span>here</span></u></a>, and both &#8220;Libre Bodoni&rdquo; and Bodoni* are licenced under the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL"><u><span>SIL Open Font License (OFL)</span></u></a>.

				<h3 class="Bodoni12M">Features</h3>
				<br><h4 class="Bodoni6M">Bodoni* feautures four weights:</h4>
				<h3 class="Bodoni12 Grey">Book</h3>
				<h4 class="Bodoni6 Grey">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil queen and Jack.</h4>
				<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Book is the ideal weight for setting paragraphs of text in. It is designed to look well composed and balanced at smaller
					sizes and is kerned to be easy on the eyes over longer sections of text. Although functional and elegant at larger sizes, it is suggested Bodoni*
					Book be reserved for smaller text sizes.
				</p><br>
				<h3 class="Bodoni12M Grey">Medium</h3>
				<h4 class="Bodoni6M Grey">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil queen and Jack.</h4>
				<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Medium is designed to look well-balanced and function better at display sizes. It features slightly tighter kerning and is
					well suited for headlines and titles. It is not recommended for body text.
				</p><br>
				<h3 class="Bodoni12 Grey"><b>Bold</b></h3>
				<h4 class="Bodoni6 Grey"><b>Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil queen and Jack.</b></h4>
				<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No typeface is complete without a <b>bold</b> weight. Text written in <b>bold</b> is more important than its surrounding text.
					Bold is to be used like curse-words: sparingly. If it is over-used it loses its meaning.
				</p><br>
				<h3 class="Bodoni6F Grey" >Fatface</h3>
				<h4 class="Bodoni6F Grey">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil queen and Jack.</h4>
				<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Fatface was invented and popularized during the industrial revolution. With the rapidly changing times, graphic-designers
					looked for a new typographic style to cut through the noise. The result was the Fatface. It is as loud, unapologetic and brassy as the nineteen-hundred's
					America that invented it. It is at home on Victorian posters advertising the circus or a new toxic medicine, available by train. indestructible type*
					celebrates this era with a new weight of Bodoni*: Fatface. Fatface is exclusively for display sizes and does not yet come with a complementary italic.
				</p><br>
				<h4 class="Bodoni6M">Bodoni* also includes pt. size variants:</h4>
				<p style="margin-top: -2em;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When typography still meant cutting letters into individual blocks of metal there was one advantage: letterforms would have a
					natural and slight variation at different point-sizes. Thin-stroke width could remain consistent as the pt. size increased. When typefaces became
					digitized designers would have to compromise on a single relative stroke size. The contrast would end up too great at smaller sizes leading to a
					&#8220;dazzle&rdquo; which would render the text difficult to read. The contrasting stroke thickness would end-up too small at larger sizes, leading to a loss
					in the feeling of elegance or refinement.
					<br>
					 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indestructible type* aims to combat this by introducing pt. size variants. The goal is to have a separate font-pack optimized for 6 pt., 12 pt., 24 pt.,
					48 pt. and 96 pt. sizes. This would allow the designer to pick the font best suited for the size being used.
				</p>
				<h3 class="Bodoni6 Grey">Bodoni* 6 Book</h3>
				<h3 class="Bodoni12 Grey">Bodoni* 12 Book</h3>
				<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At this time Bodoni* only goes up to 12 pt.
